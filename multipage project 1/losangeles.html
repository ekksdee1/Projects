                    LA is a very lively place, filled with tourists, locals, and all sorts of people! The place I visited
                    specifically was Santa Monica. It had many nice neighborhoods, but the houses were very small. That's one thing
                    I noticed about the big cities in California, unless you're very rich, you don't get a big house with a big yard
                    unlike what we have in Sylvania or even Toledo.

                    Some of the attractions that I visited were Universal Studios and the Santa Monica Pier. Universal Studios is a 
                    theme park/amusement park that doesn't really have any roller coasters; it's more about illusions that make you
                    think you're moving really fast, but the actual ride isn't. I will admit: the rides felt very real, even if I knew
                    we weren't actually moving. The Santa Monica Pier is kind of like a fair with many restaurants, amusement rides, a
                    ferris wheel, et cetera.

                    I also visited <em>The Aquarium of the Pacific</em>, as well as the Hollywood Sign. The <em>Aquarium of the 
                    Pacific</em> is a very famous aquarium in LA, I saw many aquatic animals, such as penguins, stingrays, sea lions,
                    seals, and even small sharks! The Hollywood sign was a cool place to take a picture, but there wasn't much actually
                    at the Hollywood sign. Actual Hollywood was pretty cool, and you could definitely tell the houses were meant for rich
                    people.
