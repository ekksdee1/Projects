                    Las Vegas is definitely not a city for kids. It's filled with tourists and adult themes. But, it is also a very
                    cool place to visit if you're of age (or mature enough). I mainly visited the Las Vegas strip, where all the 
                    5-star hotels are at, as well as tourist attractions. It's also worth mentioning that the food there is to die for.
                    From Gordon Ramsay owned restaurants to 5 star dining, it is definitely worth a trip if you can afford it.

                    I actually stayed here for about a week cumulatively, and I stayed in many hotels. One of the hotels I stayed in was
                    The Belagio, which I felt extremely out of place in. The hotel was so high class that one night cost us $500, I think the
                    only reason my family and I actually stayed there is because we had a discount. Right in front of the hotel, at night, they
                    have a water show in which many water jets in the front of the hotel light up and make cool patterns, almost like fireworks.

                    The Las Vegas strip uses mainly taxis to transport everyone. As a result, the taxi buisness is thriving in that area, unlike
                    how in our Toledo and Sylvania area, where Uber and whatnot has mostly replaced the need for taxis. This was very intriguing to me,
                    as I had not seen an area before with a booming taxi buisness (besides airports).

                    I also visited the Hoover Dam, which is a little bit out of the way of Vegas, but it was very cool to see how the Dam worked,
                    and it was also a very good picture.
