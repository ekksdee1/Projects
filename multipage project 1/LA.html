                    LA is a very lively place, filled with tourists, locals, and all sorts of people! The place I visited
                    specifically was Santa Monica. It had many nice neighborhoods, but the houses were very small. That's one thing
                    I noticed about the big cities in California, unless you're very rich, you don't get a big house with a big yard
                    unlike what we have in Sylvania or even Toledo.

                    Some of the attractions that I visited were Universal Studios and the Santa Monica Pier. Universal Studios is a 
                    theme park/amusement park that doesn't really have any roller coasters; it's more about illusions that make you
                    think you're moving really fast, but the actual ride isn't. I will admit: the rides felt very real, even if I knew
                    we weren't actually moving. The Santa Monica Pier is kind of like a fair with many restaurants, amusement rides, a
                    ferris wheel, et cetera.

                    I also visited <em>The Aquarium of the Pacific</em>, which is a very famous aquarium in LA. I saw many aquatic animals,
                    such as penguins, stingrays, sea lions, seals, and even small sharks!
