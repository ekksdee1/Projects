                    It's massive. I mean, really, pictures and words cannot desribe how big the Grand Canyon is. You have to really
                    be there and see it to get the full scale. The Grand Canyon is a national park that is famous for how humongous
                    it is. According to the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/basicinfo.htm">National Park Service,</a>
                    the lowest part of the canyon is 1.6km deep, or about a mile!

                    I visited the South Rim area of the Park, in which I got pictures and really saw the Canyon from a high point. I also
                    took a helicopter tour of the canyon. Honestly, the view was amazing.
