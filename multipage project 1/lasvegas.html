                    Las Vegas is definitely not a city for kids. It's filled with tourists and (some) adult themes. But, it is also a very
                    cool place to visit if you're of age (or mature enough). I mainly visited the Las Vegas strip, where all the 
                    5-star hotels are at, as well as tourist attractions. It's also worth mentioning that the food there is to die for.
                    From Gordon Ramsay owned restaurants to 5 star dining, it is definitely worth a trip if you can afford it.

                    Vegas turns into a completely different city at night. In the day, it's lively and an entertaining city, but at night it 
                    becomes this city with a huge party vibe. At night, all of the buildings and attractions are lit up, and the difference 
                    is just breathtakingâ€”especially if you have a good view from above. The Las Vegas strip uses mainly taxis to transport 
                    everyone. As a result, the taxi buisness is thriving in that area, unlike how in our Toledo and Sylvania area, where Uber 
                    and whatnot has mostly replaced the need for taxis. This was very intriguing to me, as I had not seen an area before with a 
                    booming taxi buisness (besides airports).
