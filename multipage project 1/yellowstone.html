                    Yellowstoneâ€”the U.S.'s first national park. This park, according to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm">
                    the National Park Service</a>, is 3500 square miles, or about 9000 square kilometers big. The vistors part of the
                    park is essentially made up of two loops, the upper loop and the lower loop.

                <p>
                    When I visited for 2 days, we visited both loops. When my family and I visited, many of the park's attractions were
                    dried up, so it wasn't as good as an experience as it could have been. In my opinion, the most exciting thing there was
                    the "Old Faithful" geyser. This behemoth of a geyser shoots water in the sky almost every hour and a half about 180 feet
                    high. Their ice cream was also delicious, but that's beside the point.
